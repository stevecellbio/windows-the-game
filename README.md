# windows-the-game
the newest and greatest rpg!



# What is this?
This is a game, which utiliizes windows (not the OS) to show the player's sight, instead of a window. There is a shop, you can buy extra weapons and lives, and, you can increase the size of your window. The cost? Squares.
At the start, you have 3 lives and shoot the circles at the squares, while they try to shoot circles at you! (circles kill stuff!)
As you progress, you start to go against bigger and bigger squares until there are kaiju-level fights between the triangles and the squares.
Bosses, which are Octagons, have their own seperate window, which merges with your primary window as it comes in.
The game is endless, and you cannot resize your window!
